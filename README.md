PandaViewer
=====================
Overview
---------------------
This program is aimed at helping you manage collections of manga, doujinshi, and the like.

This is done by recursively scanning a list of folders that you specify, indexing all folders/archive that contain images (png/jpg), and storing that in
our database. Galleries are displayed individually, with options for searching (tags + title) and sorting them by name, rating, read count, etc.

We also support automatically downloading metadata from EX. To do so, add your account details in the settings page and then click the action "Download Metadata".
You can also download metadata for a specific gallery by opening the gallery's menu and selecting "Download Metadata".

Each gallery can be customized with custom metadata as well. Under the gallery's menu, select "Info".



Currently we support folder galleries (i.e. loose files in a folder), ZIP/CBZ, and RAR/CBR.

Future Plans

* Adjust UI according to feedback (animation speed, text size bugs, etc)
* Create fancy Github project page.
* Support metadata collections from other websites
* Provide a pre-filled database with EX metadata.
